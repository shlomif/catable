<p>
Here's a vim tip on how to copy some non adjacent lines to a register
(<tt>"r</tt>), but first the story that made me find out about how to
do it exactly. I need to add full POD (Perl's documentation format)
coverage to a Perl module I inherited. What it means is that every
top-level function (or at least those that do not start with a "_") should
have their own entries. In Perl the function definitions goes like that:

<pre>
sub first_function {

}
