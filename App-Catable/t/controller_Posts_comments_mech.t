I've been chatting on Instant Messaging today, and accidently typed "lough"
instead of "laugh". I noticed the spell checker did not highlight it when
I corrected my mistake and decided to check what it means. Here's
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;c2coff=1&amp;safe=off&amp;defl=en&amp;q=define:lough&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=glossary_definition&amp;ct=title">the definition of "lough"</a> -
it's Irish for "lake".
</p>

<p>
It reminded me of "loch" (which is the Scottish Gaelic equivalent)
and the English word "lake" so I checked their etymologies on m-w.com. Turns
out they all stem from the same root, which is common in many
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languages">Indo-European
languages</a>.
</p>

<p>
I normally do not recall new words that I encounter, but I think I'll remember
this one. Of course, it seems too obscure to be useful.
