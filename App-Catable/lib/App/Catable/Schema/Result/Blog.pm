=head1 NAME

App::Catable::Schema::Result::Blog - a schema class representing an entire blog!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $schema = App::Catable->model("BlogDB");

    my $blog_rs = $schema->resultset('Blog');

    my $blog = $blog_rs->find({
        id => 2_400,
        });

    print $blog->display_name();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class holds meta data about an entire blog. It is intended for use
on a site which holds multiple blogs by providing a foreign key relation
to all other tables whose data may be associated with an individual blog.

In other words, this table is the table that other tables refer to when
they say "blog_id".

=head1 FIELDS

This field list also comprises a method list, since DBIC
creates accessor methods for each field.

=head2 id

Auto-incremented blog ID.

=head2 owner

This is the user id of the user that owns the blog. This is why we store
OpenID users in the account table.

=head2 url

This is the path part that will identify this user's blog. Whether this
is generated or selected by the user can be left up to the sysadmin of
the Catable installation.

=head2 title

This is the blog title and is (may be) printed on the blog's page.

=head2 theme

This is the CSS style used by the blog.

=head2 ctime

The datetime the blog was created.

=head2 mtime

The datetime the blog info was modified (not the blog posts etc)

=head2 visitor_can_set_theme

B<NOT YET IMPLEMENTED>

This is a nice-to-have that I may implement, which will alert the template
engine to the fact that the blog owner wishes the visitor to be able to
select the CSS style.

This may become a list.
